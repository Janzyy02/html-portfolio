<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  I am Mark Janolino and I'm currently a 3rd year college in BS Information
  technology in STI College Global City in the Philippines. I live in
  Philippines especially in the city of Taguig, I love playing video games and
  building computers. I got my interest in computers since I was a kid until it
  became my passion that's why I'm taking the course of Information technology.
  I'm planning to be a web developer one day because I was amaze by the modern
  websites that I visited and it led me to take the course of ms. Angela Yu from
  Udemy.

<p>
  I am aspiring to be a web developer means embarking on a journey where
  creativity meets logic, opening doors to a dynamic and in-demand career. It
  involves mastering the trinity of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to build and
  maintain the digital spaces we use every day, from sleek company websites to
  interactive applications. This path requires a commitment to lifelong
  learning, constantly keeping pace with new frameworks, libraries, and
  technologies, but the reward is the tangible satisfaction of bringing ideas to
  life on the screen and influencing how people interact with the world online.

<p>
  I have a good work ethic that characterized by a deep commitment to quality,
  reliability, and diligence. It's not just about putting in hours, but about
  the intensity and focus one brings to every task, consistently striving to
  exceed expectations and taking full ownership of outcomes. Individuals with
  this strong ethic demonstrate self-discipline, are punctual, manage their time
  effectively, and are driven by an intrinsic motivation to contribute
  positively to their team and organization, setting a powerful example for
  those around them.
